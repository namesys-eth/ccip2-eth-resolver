## Specification

### CCIP-Read Resolver (EIP-2544/EIP-3688)

This specification is an extension of ENSIP-10 (EIP-2544/EIP-3688) using mutable and immutable storage pointers for off-chain records storage.

```solidity
function resolve(bytes calldata name, bytes calldata data) external view returns(bytes memory result)
```

### Off-Chain Records Storage Format

CCIP2 relies on IPNS hashes serving as proxies to upgradeable IPFS or IPLD content. In the parent IPNS directory (called a `recordhash`), the records must be stored in the [RFC-8615](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8615) compliant `.well-known` directory format. ENS records for any name `sub.domain.eth` must then be stored in JSON format under a [reverse-DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation) style directory path using `/` instead of `.` as separator, i.e. in format `ipfs://<hash>/.well-known/eth/domain/sub/<record>.json`.

#### Some Examples:

- ENS text record for `vitalik.eth`'s avatar is stored at `ipns://<ipns_hash>/.well-known/eth/vitalik/text/avatar.json` formatted as

```solidity
{ data: abi.encode(<avatar>) }
```

- ETH address record for `sub.domain.eth` is stored at `https://<ipns_hash>/.well-known/eth/domain/sub/address/60.json` formatted as

```solidity
{ data: abi.encode(<address/60>) }
```

### Global records [Experimental]

CCIP2 also offers the experimental feature of setting a global wallet-specific `recordhash` (called a `masterhash`), which stores common records that may be shared across many names in a wallet. This feature will be enabled in the CCIP2 client in the future. When `masterhash` is enabled, the reverse-DNS path is replaced with `eth:address(<owner>)` in storage pointers.

Note: If the JSON data is signed by the Registrant of `domain.eth`, it must be prefixed with `bytes4` of `callback` function selector as,

```solidity
{ data: bytes.concat(Resolver.___callback.selector, <signedData>}
```

### d) Security

To ensure secure record resolution, records must be signed by either the owner of a domain or a domain-specific signer (called `approvedSigner`) set by the owner. The `approvedSigner` may be stored on-chain or off-chain by the owner in the CCIP2 contract. Upon each resolution, CCIP2 resolver verifies the signature against on-chain and/or off-chain `approvedSigner`, aka on-chain signer and/or off-chain signer approved by the owner.

## Resolver Function â†’ JSON Mapping

| Type | Function | JSON File |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text Records | `text(bytes32 node, string memory key)` | `text/<key>.json` |
| Ethereum Address | `addr(bytes32 node)` | `address/60.json` |
| Contenthash* | `contenthash(bytes32 node)` | `contenthash.json` |
| Multichain Address | `addr(bytes32 node, uint coinType)`| `address/<coinType>.json` |
| Public Key | `pubkey(bytes32 node)`| `pubkey.json` |
| Name** | `name(bytes32 node)`| `name.json` |
| Interface | `interfaceImplementer(bytes32 node, bytes4 _selector)`| `interface/0x<bytes4Selector>.json` |
| ABI | `ABI(bytes32 node, uint256 contentTypes)`| `abi/<contentTypes>.json` |
| Zonehash | `zonehash(bytes32 node)`| `dnsrecord/zonehash.json` |
| DNS Record | `dnsRecord(bytes32 node, bytes name, uint16 resource) `| `dnsrecord/<resource>.json` |

\* This is the user's web-facing contenthash contained inside the recordhash or masterhash

\*\* Name is not implemented as reverse record; users must use the official ENS on-chain reverse record for that feature.
